# Project
letHelpULose is a web application for those who want to lose weight and don’t have time to go to the gym or don’t have enough time or money to get a help from a health consultant. Our website provides them a weekly diet program with less money while they’re at home.

The main functions the system will perform are:
Give the paid-account user a weekly diet program.
1- Each month, the user-who participated in one of the paid programs- will update his weight in order to give him the next month diet.
2- Give the users tips and advices about health and exercise.
3- Let the users talk about their experience with our website.
4- The users can try the website for free for one week and if they want to continue, they have to choose a program and pay for it.
5- Diet programs are either 3-month participation for 25$ or 6-month participation for 40$

Free users and paid-account users: they are asked to give their:
a. Name.
b. Mobile phone.
c. Weight.
d. Age.
e. Height

Both of them can see tips, stories and delete their accounts and they will be given videos and weekly diet, but for free users, the videos will not change and diet is available for one week only. While the paid-account user will see different videos each month of the diet program and the diet will be available for three or six months depends on his choice and he can update his weight each month.

In this project, we used:
1- Languages: PHP, html+html5, CSS, bootstrap and JavaScript.
2- Tools: phpStorm, XAMPP server, Argo UML and Microsoft project.
